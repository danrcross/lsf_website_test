  <p>Upon the LSF Secretary's receipt of this application and entry into the LSF database you will be granted Aspirant status. When you have properly completed the tasks for Level 1, return the voucher to LSF and you will be given an LSF member number. This member number will be the same for both the SAP or ESAP and is good for life.</p>
  <p>There are no membership dues with LSF. The LSF operates on the honor system and your cooperation will assure prompt attention to your voucher submissions.</p>
