    <h3>Section I - Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      The LSF Soaring Accomplishments Program consists of sequential performance
      tests or "Levels", as they shall be referred to hereafter, for flying
      radio controlled (R/C) model sailplanes which meet current FAI
      specifications.
    </p>
    <h3>Section 2 - Level I (Primary)</h3>
    <p>
      The performance tasks pursuant to Level I are presented in the Soaring
      Accomplishments Program, Requirements Summary, Section12. Upon completion
      and documentation of the Level I tasks, the Aspirant must submit the
      performance documentation voucher to the LSF Executive Board for
      membership enrollment. After acceptance of the voucher, the LSF Executive
      Board will award the Member his LSF number and remit a Level II
      performance documentation voucher. The Member may then display a red I
      centered immediately below a Soaring Accomplishments Program insignia, and
      his LSF number.
    </p>
    <h3>Section 3 - Levels II Through IV (Intermediate)</h3>
    <p>
      As in the previous Level, the vouchers are submitted, accepted, and a
      voucher for the next Level is returned. As earned, the Red II will be
      displayed to the immediate left of the Soaring Accomplishments Program
      insignia, the III to the right, and the IV centered immediately above the
      insignia.
    </p>
    <h3>Section 4 - Level V (Advanced)</h3>
    <p>
      Level V is formulated to recognize advanced knowledge, skill and
      determination in R/C model soaring. Skill in slope soaring is mandatory,
      as Level V is intended to delineate extensive experience in all facets of
      R/C model soaring. The earned silver V will be displayed immediately above
      the red IV.

    <h3>Section 5 - Witnesses</h3>
    <p>
      Verification of each task of each Level requires the signature of
      qualified witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >The approved witnesses for non-competitive requirements shall
        be:</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px">
      Level I: One witness, over 21 years of age, who is not related to the
      pilot, or one witness, holding Level I status or higher, who is not
      related to the pilot.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px">Level II: Same as for Level I.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px">Level III: Two witnesses, as in Level I.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px">Level IV: Same as for Level III.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px">
      Level V: Two witnesses, each holding Level II status or higher, who are
      not related to the pilot. <br />The approved witness for competitive
      requirements shall be either the contest Director or the Official Scorer.
    </p>
    <h3>Section 6 - Procedures</h3>
    <p>
      The tasks required at all Levels must be performed with the following
      restrictions: (a) all work done at Level I must commence after the voucher
      is received: (b) requirements for the subsequent Levels may be achieved
      any time after the previous Level form has been postmarked, However, these
      said requirements will be nullified if the postmarked form sent is
      returned due to errors or incompleteness; a single performance may be used
      for only one Level.

    <h3><a name="section7">Section 7 - Thermal Duration Flight</a></h3>
    <p>
      All thermal duration tasks will commence after the launch phase is
      complete (i.e. at towline release (SAP), at the end of a 30-second motor
      run (eSAP), etc.). If a motor is used for launch, the sailplane must be
      equipped with an altitude limiting device set to a maximum launch height
      of 200 meters (656.17 feet) and a maximum motor run time of 30 seconds. A
      motor restart during the flight attempt voids that attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flight shall be deemed a thermal duration flight if, in the opinion of
      the pilot and witnesses, the lift being used to remain aloft is primarily
      attributable to thermal activity. Termination must be with a landing
      within 200 meters (656.2 feet) of the launch point, which is the point at
      which the model first become airborne.
    </p>
    <h3>Section 8 - Slope Duration Flight</h3>
    <p>
      A slope duration flight commences with either a simple hand-launch or a
      launch as defined in Section 7. The flight shall be deemed a slope
      duration flight if, in the opinion of the pilot and witnesses, the lift
      being used to remain aloft is primarily attributable to wave-action or
      winds blowing upslope on a ridge, hill, cliff, wall, etc. Termination must
      be with a landing within 200 meters (656.2 feet) of the launch point.
    </p>
    <h3>Section 9 - Precision Spot Landing</h3>
    <p>
      A precision spot landing is accomplished by landing the sailplane so that
      the extreme forward tip of the nose or forward most point of the
      longitudinal centerline, at rest, is within the required distance from the
      center of a designed spot on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      All precision spot landing flights must commence with a launch meeting the
      specifications for launch methods outlined in Section 7. Each spot landing
      attempt must have a minimum launch altitude of 100 meters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landing shall be voided if the model jettisons or loses parts, comes
      to rest in an inverted position or touches any person or object while
      landing. However, contact with a spot-marker which does not noticeably
      impede the flight or landing of the model is permissible.
    </p>
    <h3>Section 10 - Goal and Return Flight</h3>
    <p>
      A goal and return flight is a thermal duration flight which commences with
      a launch as specified in Section 7.
    </p>
    <p>
      After launching, the sailplane must be flown over the launch point and
      then to a pre-designated goal a minimum straight line distance away, as
      specified in the Soaring Accomplishments Program, Requirements summary,
      Section 12, and back to the launch point.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="section11">Section 11 - Competition</a></h3>
    <p>
      Competition requirements specified in the Soaring Accomplishments Program,
      Requirements Summary, section 12, may be fulfilled only in LSF recognized
      contests which are defined to be those meeting the following
      specifications:
    </p>
    <p><strong>A - Size</strong></p>
    <p>All contestants must compete at the same location on the same date.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px">Level II - Five (5) or more participants</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px">Level III - Ten (10) or more participants</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px">
      Level IV - Fifteen (15) or more participants
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px">Level V - Twenty (20) or more participants</p>
    <p><strong>B - Rounds</strong></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px">
      Three or more separate opportunities to score
    </p>
    <p><strong>C - Events</strong></p>
    <p>
      Fifty percent (50%) or more of the contest events must adhere to at least
      one of the following guidelines:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Thermal Event Guideline - Extended thermal duration, distance, or speed;
        precision aerobatics, or altitude.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slope Events Guideline - Duration, distance, speed, precision
        aerobatics, or altitude.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Contests must not exclude any potential competitor(s), and all launch
      methods are eligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two alternative methods of scoring may be used to meet competition
      requirements. Either the Place System, where a place is recognized to be
      first (1st), second (2nd), or third (3rd) in the final standing of a
      contest; or the Competition Points System, where a minimum total of
      competition points from any six (6) contests may be used. Competition
      points are computed by first dividing the participant's score by the
      winner's score and multiplying by 100; then, multiplying the resultant
      value by one (1) plus the number of lower standing contestants. A minimum
      of six (6) contests must be flown no matter which scoring method is used.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px">
      (a) Winner earns a score of 531 <br />(b) Participant earns a score of 312
      <br />(c) Participant beats 5 other contestants. <br />(d) Participant's
      Competition Points are: 312 / 531 x 100 x (1 + 5) = 352
    </p>
    <p><strong>D - FAI World Records</strong></p>
    <p>
      Establishing a world record - recognized by the F&Eacute;D&Eacute;RATION
      A&Eacute;RONAUTIQUE INTERNATIONALE - shall constitute the requirements for
      a contest win. However, six contests or records or a combination of six
      contests and records must be recorded on all performance vouchers from
      Level II through Level V. The 12,000 point requirement must also be
      fulfilled for Level V.
