      The highest achievement in the League of Silent Flight is the attainment
      of LEVEL V in the Soaring Accomplishment Program. Level V requires
      completion of the following tasks:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A thermal duration flight of at least two hours.</li>
      <li>A slope flight of at least eight hours.</li>
      <li>A goal and return flight of at least ten kilometers.</li>
      <li>
        Three WINS and 12,000 points in at least six contests with twenty or
        more unique contestants.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Over 130 members of LSF have completed these challenging tasks and are
      known and respected worldwide as outstanding RC model sailplane pilots. A
      plaque commemorating their achievement is on permanent display in the
      lobby of the National Model Aviation Museum at the Academy of Model
      Aeronautics in Muncie, Indiana.
