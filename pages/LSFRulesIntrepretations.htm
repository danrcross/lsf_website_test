      The LSF board has tried to make interpretations of the rules based on the
      intent, and spirit, on which the LSF was founded. Below are official LSF
      Board intrepretations of questions about the rules:

    <h2>Alpine Soaring and the Thermal Tasks</h2>
    <p>
      As an aspirant in the program, I am specifically wondering how mountain
      soaring, aka "slermalling" aka "alpine soaring," are considered for the
      purposes of LSF tasks. For example, earlier today I was flying off a slope
      overlooking a large canyon where the vast majority, and sometimes only,
      lift was coming from thermals, though there was some weak slope lift
      present right at the lip, when a thermal blew through for example. Would
      it be legitimate for me to complete my thermal duration tasks under such
      conditions?
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not ask because I am unethical, or seeking an easy way around the
      tasks, but mainly because there's literally no organized TD flying in my
      town and no interest in pursuing it. Everyone here flies slope, and there
      is some (limited) interest in the type of mountain soaring I'm talking
      about, though most people seem to prefer not to have to risk their models
      to the vagaries of mountain thermals and the possiblity of a long and
      difficult retrieval.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, my question is: when there is no flat field thermalling available to
      you, can mountain soaring in thermals count towards your TD tasks for the
      LSF?
    </p>
    <h2>Official LSF position:</h2>
    <p>
      Please note that the Soaring Achievement Program separates slope soaring
      and thermal soaring both in spirit and intent. Thermal soaring implies
      flatland soaring as opposed to using the "mechanical" lift found at the
      slope. Now let's go to the rules...
    </p>
    <p>
      The Thermal Duration requirements (<a
        href="LSFTasksAndTaskSheets.htm#section7"
        target="main"
        >Section 7</a
      >) on the LSF website states:
    </p>
    <p><i>Section 7 - Thermal Duration Flight</i></p>
    <p>
      <i
        ><strong><span style="color: #3366ff">SAP:</span></strong> A thermal
        duration flight commences at the time of release from the end of towline
        or at release of hand launch. The distance from the extreme end of
        towline, at the winch, hi-start hold-down, towman, vehicle, or towline
        return device to the attach point at the model shall be no more than 300
        meters (984.3 feet). Tow men and vehicles shall be limited to a maximum
        of sixty (60) seconds from launch to towline release. Towing by means of
        aircraft or other airborne devices is expressly forbidden.</i
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <i
        ><strong><span style="color: #3366ff">eSAP:</span></strong> All thermal
        duration tasks will be attempted with an electric sailplane equipped
        with an altitude limiting device set to a maximum launch height of 200
        meters (656.2 feet) and a maximum motor run time of 30 seconds. The
        flight commences when the sailplane leaves the pilot or helpers hand or
        when the sailplane leaves the ground if a rise-off-ground takeoff is
        used. A motor restart voids the flight attempt.</i
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <i
        >A flight shall be deemed a thermal duration flight if, in the opinion
        of the pilot and witnesses, the lift being used to remain aloft is
        primarily attributable to thermal activity. Termination must be with a
        landing within 200 meters (656.2 feet) of the launch point, which is the
        point at which the model first become airborne.</i
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      So filtering your question through the above, if the opinion of you and
      your witnesses is that the primary source of lift is from thermals and not
      slope lift (3rd paragraph), then alpine thermalling can qualify for your
      TD tasks (in the letter of the law). I will say that most people I know in
      the program achieved their thermal tasks in a flatland venue, not in an
      alpine environment. That may be due to interpretations of the rules or the
      lack of alpine sites. As the tasks get longer, the "primarily attributable
      to" phrase takes on more meaning... During an 8 hour slope flight, for
      example, I'm sure most of the Level V's took some time to thermal just to
      give them a break from figure 8's at eye level at the slope. At the end of
      the day, the Soaring Achievement Program is one of personal milestones set
      against a standard that has held up for 35 years. Those participating in
      and advancing through the program can take away the fact that they are
      traveling a path shared by many notables in the hobby... It's all about
      the journey and the friends you make and maintain along the way.

    <h2>LSF Opinion On Contests That May Not Meet Recognized Contest Test</h2>
    <p>
      Due to some recent questions on the R/C Soaring Exchange (RCSE), an email
      soaring exchange, about LSF Recognized Contests, the following are the
      official interpretations of the LSF board: In order for a contest to be in
      the Spirit of LSF, it must be open to all flyers, with no exclusions for
      LSF level, experience or prior contest achievement. It must have
      sufficient individual "Participants", not entries, to match the criteria
      for the level you are working on. Separate airplane classes are considered
      separate contests. An overall of all classes may be used instead as long
      as there are a sufficient number of individual flying "Participants" to
      meet the criteria for the level you are working on. Three or more scored
      rounds are required.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>October 3, 2001</h2>
    <p>
      Several weeks ago there was a discussion on RCSE from a few fellas on the
      East coast about the what the "Minimum of six contests required" statement
      on the front of the Soaring Accomplishments Program Voucher really meant.
      One fella was convinced that you could put only your best 6 out of however
      many contest you flew, and another group of guys were convinced that you
      could list as many as you needed, but a minimum of 6, and a seperate sheet
      of paper to accumulate the required points for what ever Level you were
      working on. I was asked to make an interpretation on the matter, in which
      I did, which caused even a little more grief for some of those involved.
      The interpretation that I made was that one had to have a minimum 6
      contests on the voucher, but could continue to accumulate points on a
      seperate sheet of paper attached to the voucher.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>This interpretation was incorrect!!</strong> I apologize to all
      parties concerned. After conferring with a number of past presidents, a
      number of older LSF Level V Aspirants (You know the ones, the ones that
      were flying when main street was dust!), and after reviewing the bylaws
      and the reverse side of the Soaring Accomplishments Program Voucher, the
      following interpretation will now stand as a precedent:
    </p>
    <p>
      A <strong>"Minimum of six contests required"</strong> on the voucher face,
      and only your six best Contests will be listed for whatever you need to
      achieve the points required for that Level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Listed on the back of the voucher under the Events you will find...<strong
        >"or the Competition Points System, where a minimum total of competition
        points from any six (6) contests may be used."</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      What does this mean? You can not do the 20 year add 'em up as was
      discussed earlier. You put your 6 best out of however many contests it
      takes. The intent here is to get you off your duff and out from the club
      field to other places, bigger contests, and meet new people.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ruling is consistent with what was intended by the founders and is
      the same path that people like Dan Pruss and many others have followed
      including myself.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>July 19, 2001</h2>
    <p>
      There apparently is some confusion about what really defines an LSF
      Contest for the proposes of LSF Points and/or an LSF Contest Win.
      Evidently, there are those who are not following the intent, nor the
      design, of the Aspirant Program as the rest of the United States or the
      world for that matter. The SOARING ACCOMPLISHMENTS PROGRAM of the LEAGUE
      OF SILENT FLIGHT, is a personal achievement program, based on a witness
      and honor system. To read in between the lines of the rules as stated on
      the back of the voucher is only self serving, and a disrespect for those
      who have walked the path before you. When a voucher is receive by the
      Secretary, he or she will validate it by checking signatures, contests
      scores, and the like. With access to the internet this task becomes easier
      than ever before.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The LSF Board in not the LSF Police!!</strong> That said we do
      make a reasonable attempt to verify each and every aspirant form and if we
      think there is an issue, the form is returned with the appropriate
      explanation. Lately there has been some confusion about what makes up an
      LSF Contest, although the rules are clear. In
      <a href="LSFTasksAndTaskSheets.htm#section11" target="main">Section 11</a>
      on the back of the Aspirant Form, the board will offer the following
      definitions and discussion to establish what is a recognized contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Event - The gathering of folks to fly model airplanes, to compete
      against each other, for fun, "skill improvement", and the meeting of other
      people. This is the basic foundation on which the LSF was formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Contest - A task or series of tasks, at the Event, "performed by the
      same participants together", within a given time period, designed to
      perpetuate a ranking of the participants (Contestants), or the folks that
      came to the event. A contest within a contest would be, for LSF purposes,
      a classification...
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Classifications - Very similar to a contest, when used in an Event,
      where participants are segregated into groups of like fliers, or airplane
      types, "open to all contestants". Those Flying in a particular class for
      LSF points must meet the requirements of
      <a href="LSFTasksAndTaskSheets.htm#section11" target="main">Section 11</a>
      within each classification.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Rounds - The individual tasks flown that make up the contest. There
      must be at least 3 rounds within the contest to make a valid LSF contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Tasks - That work that is performed by all contestants, within a
      contest, such to perpetuate a ranking of said contestants.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the above being said, if you have a 2-day Event and the contests are
      designated as 2-day, be it Rudder/Elevator/Spoiler (RES), Nostalgia,
      Unlimited, 2-Meter, or Open (with Master, Sportsman, Novice type
      classifications), and the contests are designated as a 2-day
      contest,<strong
        >you can not count 1 day, or 1/2, of the contest for LSF points and/or a
        LSF win.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a 2-day Event and designate single day contests contained
      within, then you have 2 opportunities to score LSF points and/or an LSF
      win. Additionally, if there is a Hi-Point Overall Designation, then there
      is a 3rd opportunity for LSF points and/or win. End of year or season,
      Club or Organizational Point Championship Series awards will not be
      considered for LSF points or wins. This should clear up any misconceptions
      of the intent of the rules. This is not open for reinterpretation.

    <h2>June 27, 2001</h2>
    <p>
      I entered the Whiz Bang Contest in Anytown, USA. This AMA sanctioned two
      day contest is sponsored each year by the Hot Air Soaring Society. The
      contest was held on Saturday, June 25 and Sunday, June 26, 2001. There
      were 3 classifications - Open, RES and Gray Cup. I entered in the Gray
      cup. At the end of scoring on Saturday, I was in first place Gray Cup.
      Gray cup had 20 entrants, Saturday's contest had 4 rounds (opportunities
      to score) and was classified as a thermal duration contest. My
      interpretation of
      <a href="LSFTasksAndTaskSheets.htm#section11" target="main">Section 11</a>
      on the LSF blue sheet indicates that I have met the LSF V criterion of a
      win - all contestants must compete at the same location on the same
      date... This generated a hornets nest of dialog with some LSF'ers saying
      that I had earned my win, while others said that I hadn't because it was a
      two-day contest. (I came in second in the Gray Cup over the two days).
      Individuals implied that there has been precedence already set that allows
      the winner of the first days event to claim a win. Others, like (the CD)
      say no, because it was a two-day event, and I did not win the overall
      contest.
    </p>
    <h2>Official LSF position:</h2>
    <p>
      Your interpretation of
      <a href="LSFTasksAndTaskSheets.htm#section11" target="main">Section 11</a>
      for the contest win is not valid for 2 reasons:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. This Contest was defined by the event organizers and/or the Contest
      Director as a 2-Day Contest. You can not claim a Contest Win with 1/2 the
      Contest finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The "Gray Cup" Class you were flying in is restricted to those &gt;60
      years of age. Even though there were 20 contestants, this win would not be
      permitted unless everyone in the entire contest was over age 60.
    </p>
    <p>
      This precedent was set 2 years ago when some people tried to run an LSF
      Level V contest by excluding Level V people from competing, thus
      guaranteeing a contest win. Note that Open and RES classes are not
      considered "Restricted Classes".
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>June 19, 2001</h2>
    <p>
      I am doing some research and wondered how F3J contest points would be
      accumulated for LSF points. Specifically I am interested in the impact (or
      not) of the fly offs. Do you calculate the points based on the qualifying
      scores or some other method? Thanks - Jim Monaco
    </p>
    <h2>Official LSF position:</h2>
    <p>1. An F3J event / contest is comprised of:</p>
    <p>(A) Qualifying Contest. "Qualifier"</p>
    <p>(B) Final Contest. "Fly-off"</p>
    <p>
      The final contest is not considered a restricted contest because all
      contestants from the qualifier had the opportunity to compete in this
      contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Referring to items A, B, and C of
      <a href="LSFTasksAndTaskSheets.htm#section11" target="main">Section 11</a>
      of the Soaring Accomplishments Program of the League of Silent Flight:
    </p>
    <p>
      (A) The "Qualifier" will count as a LSF Contest provided that it meets all
      of the referred to criteria, and/or
    </p>
    <p>
      (B) The "Fly-off" will count as an LSF Contest provided that it meets all
      of the referred to criteria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note the "Fly-off" must be at least 3 rounds to be counted as a separate
      contest.
